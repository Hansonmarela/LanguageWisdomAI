LanguageWisdomAI is an AI prompt project that use artificial intelligence (AI) to gather knowledge from a variety of text sources, including papers, articles, blog posts, essays, presentations, talks, podcast transcripts, and lectures.

### Probelm
Too much excellent information exists, and too little time.

### LanguageWisdomAI
The project aims to provide the points that, given two to three hours to thoroughly study the content and systematically take handwritten notes on the most intriguing details, I would have preferred to document by hand.

These include:

A summary of the content
The main ideas
The most insightful quotes
The most interesting opinions
Influences of the speakers or the content
Habits of the speakers
Facts or background on the topics
Resources for further reading
Nuggets of wisdom
Recommendations based on what was talked about
A rating of how urgently you should watch the whole thing
